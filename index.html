            <h3>Preparing for Courses</h3>
                <h4>Timetable</h4> 
                  <p>Most Informatics courses will consist of lectures and tutorials. For detailed information on the location and time of your lectures and tutorials, check your timetable. Once you register for courses, an automatically created timetable will be available for you on <a href="www.myed.ed.ac.uk" target="_blank">MyEd</a>. To view your timetable, select "Studies" in the naviagation bar to view a sub menu and then select "Timetabling."</p>
                <h4>Tutorials</h4>
                  <p>Tutorials occur on average once a week and are most often conducted in Forrest Hill. Depending on your course, you will either be automatically assigned a tutorial section or your course organizer will create an alternative way to choose your section. You may not this information until your first lecture of the course.</p>
            <h3>Dice</h3>
              <h4>What Is Dice</h4>
                <p>DICE stands for <b>D</b>istributed <b>I</b>nformatics <b>C</b>omputing <b>E</b>nvironment. It is the computing service developed, maintained and supported by University of Edinburgh. There are DICE computers (Linux desktop PCs) in the public spaces and meeting rooms of the Informatics Forum and Forrest Hill. 
              <h4>Setting Up a Dice Account</h4>
                <p>You need DICE Account before you can access any of the computing services provided by Informatics. This account allows you to log in to any of the DICE computers. A DICE account will be created automatically for you if you are a new informatics student and an email will be sent to you that allows you to create a password. Alternatively, you can set up the password on the <a href="http://pp.inf.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Informatics Password Portal</a>.</p>
              <h3>Further Support</h3>
                <p>If you need assistance regarding your Tutor, Courses or Dice account, contact the Informatics Support Offices below:
